Ribosomes link amino acids together in the order specified by messenger RNA ( mRNA ) molecules . Ribosomes consist of two major components : the small ribosomal subunit , which reads the RNA , and the large subunit , which joins amino acids to form a polypeptide chain . Each subunit is composed of one or more ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) molecules and a variety of ribosomal proteins ( r - protein or rProtein ) . The ribosomes and associated molecules are also known as the translational apparatus .",
