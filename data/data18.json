I do n't have like a regular 9 -- 5 job ... so might as well go to Ibiza , right ? I had never been there before . So I went . We were at his show and I was drinking at the time . I just sort of moseyed out into the audience to watch Avicii spin from their point of view . I would go back and forth between the backstage and the VIP area and then where the actual kids were . And most people did n't know who the fuck I was in Ibiza except for this one guy who recognized me . He was like , ' Are you Mike Posner ? ' and he was all excited . He holds up this little bag of pills and is like , ' You want one ? ' And drunk Mike Posner was like , ' Fuck it , yeah . ' So I took one and I had never done that before , and then I felt amazing .
